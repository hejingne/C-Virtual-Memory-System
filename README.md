# C-Virtual-Memory-System
Simulate the operation of page tables and implement several page replacement algorithms for the course "Operating System" from University of Toronto. Received a mark of 100/100.

## Overview
- Build a three-level page table
- Support virtual-to-physical address translation
- Implement four different page replacement algorithms: FIFO, Clock, exact LRU, MRU using data structure such as Stack and Structs.
- Compare the runtime of each paging algorithms and analyze results in `README.txt` with regards to metrics such as:
   * Hit rate
   * Hit count
   * Miss count
   * Overall eviction count
   * Clean eviction count
   * Dirty eviction count
